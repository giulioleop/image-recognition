NEURAL NETWORKS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION

This research project aims to create models which can achieve good results
(identified as achieving over 50% accuracy) in a short computational time by modeling an
Artifical Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to verify and
compare the capability of these systems in image recognition. These models are then
optimised to improve the result and tackle overfitting. The dataset taken into consideration is
the Cifar-10, pubblicly available on UCI repository
The criteria of success has been determined by comparing the validation accuracy of the
models. Considering that the dataset has 10 different classification instances, by randomly
guessing there would be a 10% probability of being correct, therefore any model that
provides an accuracy of over 10% can be considered a positive improvement. In this case, a
simple and light model which can provide an accuracy of over 50% would be considered a
good result.
In scientific literature it is recognised how CNN seem to be among the best techniques for
image recognition models. However, to achieve high or very high-performing results, these
can be daunting in terms of time, system requirements and optimisation. This project wants
to explore if ANN can be a valid alternative for achieving good results, which steps can be
taken to improve the performance, and then make a comparison with a CNN model built on
top of a similar structure.

To answer the research question, this project has followed four steps:
1) Creation of a baseline ANN
2) Optimisation of the baseline model by adding a drop out regolarisation and tuning the
learning rate
3) Creating a CNN built upon the previous network
4) Optimising the CNN model
